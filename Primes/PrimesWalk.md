# Primes Walk

The Primes Walk is an exploration of patterns found in prime numbers, and various ways to plot these findings.

## Primes Walk Algorithm

>The algorithm takes as input the positive integers, starting at 1.
>Initial plotter heading = 0 degrees (pointing right on the page)
>For Each number N:
>  If N is composite, Move 1 unit horizontally along current heading
>  If N is prime, Move Up 1, turn 90 degrees left, then Move 1 on this heading

Plot each point.  

### Notes
I wrote the original in Java back in the 2000's when I was learning OO programming.
I no longer have that version, but I may rewrite this in Python one day.
